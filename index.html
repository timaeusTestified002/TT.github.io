                  My name is TT, or in full timaeusTestified. <br>
                  23M there is not much I am willing to give in this regard. <br>
				   I am a current Uni student, studying CS full time. On the side I do lots of projects both coding wise and to do with music.
				   I often play games in my downtime, I would be happy to share any that I'm currently interested in.
